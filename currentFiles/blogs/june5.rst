===================

Today just continuing trying to get the python 3 enviorment going. Ben helped me get the VS2010 installed. But it seems not to have the dreaded *vcvarsal.bat* file...

Ok, so I am have figured out that the VS2010 I have installed is really *Visual Studios Team Explorer 10.0*. This by default does not include the oh so necessary *vcvarsal.bat*...
