Wednesday, June 4th
====================


Finished up the initial update of the *requirments.txt* file this morning. Commited it to my forked github repo. Now I just need to work on getting VS 2010 installed and working correctly so that I can install all the packages that depend on it. I've email Ben with this issue and he is getting it sorted out. (Hopefully)

Now I am just studying up on porting python from 2-3. Some usefull links I found.
